# Bass Emulator Android App
## About the Project
A bass guitar emulator developed for Android, inspired by [Real Bass](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.rodrigokolb.realbass). The project is an implementation that combines precise interactivity, realistic visual feedback, and audio control.

## Key Features
- 🎸 Complete bass neck interface with 22 frets
- 🎵 4 strings with distinct sounds (G, D, A, E) and different thicknesses
- 🎯 Visual feedback system with:
  - Custom string vibration animations
  - Touch effects with specific colors for each string
  - Visual positioning indicators
- 🔄 Neck navigation system with:
  - Position control via sliding pick
  - Dynamic fret scale adjustment
  - Smooth transitions between positions
- 🎚️ Performance controls:
  - Sustain button for note duration control
  - Stop All function for immediate interruption
  - Tactile response when touching strings
## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Kotlin + XML
- **Custom Views**: 
  - Custom view implementation
  - Proprietary rendering and animation system
  - Visual state management
- **Architecture**: 
  - MVVM + Clean Architecture
  - State management with LiveData
  - Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin
- **Audio**: Android SoundPool with state management
- **Animations**: Custom animation system with ValueAnimator
## Technical Highlights
